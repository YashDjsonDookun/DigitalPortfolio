                                Hello folks, my name is Yash Djson Dookun.
                                <br>
                                <br> I am a Tech hobbyist and a 2nd Year Web & Multimedia Development student at the University of Mauritius. I enjoy programming a lot and spend most of my time behind a PC screen! In the past months or so, I've also been
                                trying a lot of computer operating systems (most specifically Linux distros).
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                I enjoy finding ways in which people are digitally vulnerable and hopefully be able to help in finding adequate solutions. I created this site to share my interests, as they evolve, and connect with you all (and also because it was a requirement for one
                                of my course modules).
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            This course offers web and multimedia development skills, which are focused on internet technologies such as the design and implementation of web-based client/server systems.

                        <br>
                        <p>The course is designed to ensure that students possess a broad range of computing knowledge and skills, and it includes core modules in general software design and development, as well as in scripting technologies specific for
                            web development.
                            <br> The Programme is aimed at those who wish to pursue a broader career related to the design, development and implementation of Internet-based Information Systems. It covers a range of techniques that will be invaluable to
                            those intending to follow a technical, managerial or organizational role within the field of Information Systems.
