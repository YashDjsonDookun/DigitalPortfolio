								Hello folks, my name is Yash Djson Dookun.
								<br>
								<br>
								I am a Tech hobbyist and a 2nd Year Web & Multimedia Development student at the University of Mauritius.  I enjoy programming a lot and spend most of my time behind a PC screen! In the past months or so, I've also been trying a lot of computer operating systems (most specifically Linux distros).
							</p>
							<br>
								<p>
									I enjoy finding ways in which people are digitally vulnerable and hopefully be able to help in finding adequate solutions. I created this site to share my interests, as they evolve, and connect with you all (and also because it was a requirement for one of my course modules).
