                            It's been a few weeks since we've gotten into the 1st Semester of this 2nd Year.
                            <br>
                            <br> The main module that requested this digital portfolio - <strong>LLC 2050Y - 2D Animation Tools and Techniques</strong> - promised to englobe a series of practicals w.r.t to Animation (tools/techniques). For one of the
                            first assignments, we were given a series of turorials and practicals on Gifs to go through and complete.
                            <br> Now, Gifs are used almost by everyone in this modern era of social media and instant messaging revolution... But! How exactly are Gifs created?
                            <br> I've always known that if Gifs are like "small videos", they should obviously be created in Video Editing Softwares such as Adobe Premiere Pro, KdenLive, etc... Hell, I've personally seen smartphones instantly turn video
                            clips/recordings into gifs at the click of a button... HOWEVER, you might be just as surprised as I was to know that Gifs can be created from Scratch using one of, if not the, most popular Photo Editing/Manipulation software
                            on the market.
                            <br>
                            <br>Yes! I'm talking of :

                            <i>A GIF - Graphics Interchange Format - is a bitmap image format that was developed in 1987 that supports up to 8bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colors
                                    chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. <br>
                                    It supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame, uses the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality.

                            <b style="font-size: 28px; text-decoration: underline;">What is a storyboard?</b>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                According to <a href="https://graphicdesign.sfcc.spokane.edu/dZine/projects/exercises/multimedia/files/storyboarding.pdf" style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>this source</i></a>, a storyboard is a number of drawings,
                                supported with directional notes, that form a visual script for an animation.
                            </p>
                            <p>A storyboard visually tells the story of an animation panel by panel, kind of like a comic book.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>Now, there are many reasons why storyboarding is important: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It is during the storyboarding phase that most of the errors related to narration, media, and other relevant details are identified.</li>
                                <li>It is while creating the storyboard that you can test if certain punch lines or dialogues would work as you have imagined before.</li>
                                <li>Storyboards contain notes to developers like what media to be used, what elements get synched with which part of the audio narration, which elements would be clickable, and the resultant reaction. This gives a comprehensive
                                    idea of how the course would flow in its entirety. So, the storyboard serves as the blueprint for the module and guides not just the developer, but also the quality controller on how the visualizer has envisioned the
                                    module screen by screen.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>In short, A storyboard reveals whether a concept will work or not.</p>
                            <p>But... Here's the thing - I hate drawing!</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Luckily, the internet is full of resources and templates available for use with little modifications required. <br> One other great advantage of being in the modern era is that there are tools readily available to ease the
                                process of drawing thanks to Digital Art. Using tools like Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator vastly decreases the hassle of creating step by step drawings to visually convey messages/stories and hence storyboarding.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>When I first came across the term "Storyboard", I always thought that only pictures would be involve - WRONG! <br> On a professional scale, actual words have to be used and mind you that specific jargons are to be used too!!</p>
                            <img style="margin-top: 3vh;" src="./assets/images/Storyboard/storyboard2.png" alt="">
                            <br>
                            <p>Specific camera movements and location have to be specified - Dialogues are to be inserted - the more details added, the better!!</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Anyhow, through this course, I got a new perspective on the world of animations, storytelling, VISUAL-Storytelling and so much more; although I still do not enjoy creating animations and definitely not going through the hassle
                                of Storyboarding despite all the tools.</p>
