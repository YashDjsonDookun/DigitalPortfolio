                            <u><h4 style="font-size: 25px;">What is Adobe Animate?</h4></u>
                            <br> If we listen to what <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Animate" target=_blank>Wikipedia</a></u> has to say... Adobe Animate is "a multimedia authoring anc computer animation program developed by Adobe Systems."
                            <br> One fun aspect of this Module that we are studying, is that we get to learn how to make animations, how the work and make amusing little projects. Adobe Animate is a great tool for these stuffs as it can be used to design
                            <u class="link-oldPortfolio vector">vector graphics</u> and animations for a plethora of entertainment/educational platforms. <br> Adobe Animate, now the industry standard software for animations, was formerly known as <strong>Adobe Flash Professional</strong>which
                            was previously a dominant platform for online multimedia content.The latter is now officially deprecated. <br>
                            <br> My first assignments using Adobe Animate were comprised mostly of a set of Practicals; but really, what I enjoyed the most was the 3rd Practical Exercise. One could say that it was my first True Animation. <br>
                            <img src="./assets/images/Animations/Bird.gif" style="width: 620px; height: 375px;" alt="">
                            <br> After that, it was time for the real Assignments to start. <br> My first task was rather unexpected, I had to do an Animated Valentine's Day Card that would moving along with some background music once the user would interact
                            with it. <br>
                            <div class="thumbnails">
                                <div class="animationThumbnail">
                                    <img class="valentines" src="./assets/images/AdobeAnimate/Animation_Thumbnail/valentines.png" alt="" onclick="openPage('Valentines')">
                                    <p><u>(Click on the Image to open the Animation)</u></p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br> I have to admit, to some degree, it did come out like I intended it to; But,there are some 'issues' with it...
                            <ul>
                                <li>For instance, you I originally planned to make it in way that the user would simply have to Click for the animation to start, but as you can see, it is not the case - One will have to Click and Hold to see the whole animation.</li>
                                <li>I wanted to make in such a way where the Card would stay in place with the hearts popping out of it when the Animation ends - I wanted the user to manually restart it; but I ended up leaving it as it is.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <br> Adobe Animate, being so feature rich, allows you to have crazy fun and let your imagination take the lead. With a vast community and support found on the Web, One can make use of free resources such as templates and assets
                            to make their Animations; and so did I.
                            <br>Below is a mix of practicals and assignments that I carried out by making use of the Adobe Animate Software throughout this Semester (One of which being a Team Project).
